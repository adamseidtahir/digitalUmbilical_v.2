# Website for Body Intelligence Collective

I made this website for the Body Intelligence Collective. Focusing on the 
project Digital Umbilical that was created throughout 2018-2019. The website was 
primarily important for attracting new collaborators and funding bodies. So it is aimed
at being informative but also at visually conveying the work itself through images.
